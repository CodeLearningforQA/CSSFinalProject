            Greeting to all viewers! I am a K20 student, from FPT University. Before getting straight into the content.
            I have something for you all to know.<br>
            This website, basically, is my Coursera CSS Web Learning project. All information on this web is from parts
            of FPT PRO192 study materials. The material is taken in nearly middle of May 2025.
            <br>The content on this material website may change over time, I'm doing my best to complete it fully.
            <br><br><a style="font-weight: bold;">THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU FOR READING THESE!</a>

        <p>
            Modern software applications are intricate, dynamic and complex. The number of lines of code can exceed the hundreds of thousands or millions. These applications evolve over time. 
            Some take years of programming effort to mature. Creating such applications involves many developers with different levels of expertise. 
            Their work consists of smaller stand alone and testable sub-projects; sub-projects that are transferrable, practical, upgradeable and possibly even usable within other future applications. 
            The principles of software engineering suggest that each component should be highly cohesive and that the collection of components should be loosely coupled. Object-oriented languages provide the tools for implementing these principles.

        </p>
        <p>
            Object-oriented programming reflects the way in which we manage day-to-day tasks. 
            Professor Miller of Princeton University demonstrated that most of us can only comprehend about seven chunks of information at a time. As children, we learn to play with small sets of chunks at an early age. As we grow, we learn to break down the problems that we face into sets of manageable chunks.
        </p>
        <p>
            A chunk in object-oriented programming is called an object. The shared structure of a set of similar objects is called their class. This shared structure includes the structure of the data in the similar objects as well as the logic that works on that data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This chapter introduces the concepts of object, class, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. Subsequent chapters elaborate on each concept in detail.
